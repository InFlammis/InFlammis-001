## **Space invaders** meets **Quake**

What's that?

A duel in a Quake arena where two little green aliens fight for their life? 

Or two powerful gladiators fighting to the death in a two dimensional world like Space invaders? No, nothing like that.

But...

What if a spaceship shooter is bred with a fast-action arena-based game? 

What if the mechanics of a Bullet Hell game are unleashed in a closed arena, where the player has to fight to survive against hordes of enemies, in a timed match, through increasingly difficult levels? 

What if we could also manage our arsenal in real-time to build our tactics, use the most fearsome weapon against the baddest enemy, dodge tons of bullets and collect precious power-ups that sky-rocket our badassness?


Well yeah, That would be a hell of a game!
